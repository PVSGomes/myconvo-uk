Risk Plan
Seasonal Work MyConvo.uk is a seasonal business that operates in January and September of each year. To reduce the risk of losing revenue during off-seasons, we will implement marketing strategies to promote various degree programs and educational offerings by universities and other educational institutions.

Competition from Existing Organizations
There may be existing organizations that assist colleges with processing and organizing graduations, which could pose a risk to MyConvo.uk. To mitigate this risk, we will explore opportunities for partnerships with event organizers to expand our services.

Data Privacy and University Regulations
MyConvo.uk stores sensitive information such as student addresses, email addresses, and payment information, which could be at risk of a data breach or exposure. To ensure compliance with GDPR and other university policies, we will implement strict security measures and conduct regular data privacy audits.

University Approval
The success of MyConvo.uk depends on university approval, which could pose a risk if universities reject the software. To mitigate this risk, we will conduct surveys and feedback sessions with universities to ensure that the platform meets their needs and requirements.
